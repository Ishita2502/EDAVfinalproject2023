    "text": "1 Introduction:\nAdolescents are the most vulnerable population to initiate tobacco use. It is now well established that most of the adult users of tobacco start tobacco use in childhood or adolescence. There has been a perceptible fall in smoking in developed countries after the realization of the harmful effects of tobacco. The tobacco companies are now aggressively targeting their advertising strategies in developing countries like India. Understanding the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use in specific demographics, such as school-going children aged 13-15, is crucial for implementing targeted interventions and prevention strategies. The GYTS-4 is a robust survey designed to produce national estimates, providing valuable data on various aspects of tobacco use among school-going children.\nSmoking in teens is a growing concern for several reasons, reflecting the potential short-term and long-term health, social, and economic consequences, like:\n\nHealth Risks: Adolescents who smoke are exposed to the same health risks as adults, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and various cancers.\nAddiction and Nicotine Dependence: Teens are more vulnerable to developing nicotine dependence than adults as the adolescent brain is still developing, and exposure to nicotine during this critical period can lead to addiction, making it harder for individuals to quit smoking later in life.\nEarly Initiation Leads to Lifelong Habits: Research indicates that individuals who start smoking during adolescence are more likely to continue smoking into adulthood.\nImpact on Academic Performance: Smoking can negatively impact academic performance. Nicotine can affect concentration, memory, and cognitive function, potentially hindering a teen’s ability to succeed in school.\nSocial and Behavioral Consequences: Smoking may lead to isolation, strained relationships with non-smoking peers, and engagement in risky behaviors. Additionally, smoking is often associated with other substance use.\n\nTo address these concerns, comprehensive and evidence-based tobacco control strategies, including education, prevention programs, and policy measures, are crucial to reduce the prevalence of smoking among teenagers and protect their long-term health and well-being. We are attempting to figure out trends among teens currently smoking in each state, segregated by rural and urban areas, and assess how these trends are affected by exposure to tobacco smoke at home and in public places. Additionally, we aim to understand the impact of advertisements, warning labels, promotions, bans, and awareness programs initiated by their schools.\nSome questions that we plan to answer after our exploratory analysis and visualizations are:\n\nHow do tobacco use rates (both ever use and current use) vary among states and between urban and rural areas in India?\nHow easily can young individuals access tobacco products through stores and paan shops in different states across India?\nHow effective are anti-tobacco messages and policies in mitigating tobacco use among the youth in India?\nTo what extent are tobacco control policies (COTPA) implemented and adhered to in schools across various states in India?\nDo states with more robust implementation of policies regarding tobacco-free schools experience lower rates of tobacco use among students?"

Released Under: National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP)\nContributor: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare, International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) The data is obtained from the fourth round of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS-4) conducted in 2019 by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). The survey was designed to produce national estimates of tobacco use among school-going children aged 13-15 years at the state level and Union Territory (UT) by sex, location of school (rural-urban), and management of school (public-private). The first three rounds of GYTS were conducted in 2003, 2006, and 2009.\nA total of 97,302 students from 987 schools (Public-544; Private-443) participated in the survey. Of these, 80,772 students aged 13-15 years were considered for reporting. The objective of the survey was to provide information on tobacco use, cessation, second-hand smoke, access and availability, exposure to anti-tobacco information, awareness and receptivity to tobacco marketing, knowledge, and attitudes.\nEach row consists of 58 variables including (but not limited to) the percent of current tobacco, cigarette, and bidi users in each Indian state (rural and urban), the median age of initiation, exposure at home, source of products, access to advertisements, anti-smoking campaigns, and percentage of schools creating awareness and following guidelines to be tobacco-free."
