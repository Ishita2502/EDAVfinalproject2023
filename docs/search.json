    "text": "1.1 About the topic\nAdolescents are the most vulnerable population to initiate tobacco use. It is now well established that most of the adult users of tobacco start tobacco use in childhood or adolescence. There has been a perceptible fall in smoking in developed countries after the realization of the harmful effects of tobacco. The tobacco companies are now aggressively targeting their advertising strategies in developing countries like India. Understanding the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use in specific demographics, such as school-going children aged 13-15, is crucial for implementing targeted interventions and prevention strategies. The GYTS-4 is a robust survey designed to produce national estimates, providing valuable data on various aspects of tobacco use among school-going children."

    "text": "1.2 Inspiration\nSmoking in teens is a growing concern for several reasons, reflecting the potential short-term and long-term health, social, and economic consequences, like:\n\nHealth Risks: Adolescents who smoke are exposed to the same health risks as adults, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and various cancers.\nAddiction and Nicotine Dependence: Teens are more vulnerable to developing nicotine dependence than adults as the adolescent brain is still developing, and exposure to nicotine during this critical period can lead to addiction, making it harder for individuals to quit smoking later in life.\nEarly Initiation Leads to Lifelong Habits: Research indicates that individuals who start smoking during adolescence are more likely to continue smoking into adulthood.\nImpact on Academic Performance: Smoking can negatively impact academic performance. Nicotine can affect concentration, memory, and cognitive function, potentially hindering a teen’s ability to succeed in school.\nSocial and Behavioral Consequences: Smoking may lead to isolation, strained relationships with non-smoking peers, and engagement in risky behaviors. Additionally, smoking is often associated with other substance use.\n\nTo address these concerns, comprehensive and evidence-based tobacco control strategies, including education, prevention programs, and policy measures, are crucial to reduce the prevalence of smoking among teenagers and protect their long-term health and well-being. We are attempting to figure out trends among teens currently smoking in each state, segregated by rural and urban areas, and assess how these trends are affected by exposure to tobacco smoke at home and in public places. Additionally, we aim to understand the impact of advertisements, warning labels, promotions, bans, and awareness programs initiated by their schools."

The first three rounds of GYTS were conducted in 2003, 2006, and 2009.\nA total of 97,302 students from 987 schools (Public-544; Private-443) participated in the survey. Of these, 80,772 students aged 13-15 years were considered for reporting. The objective of the survey was to provide information on tobacco use, cessation, second-hand smoke, access and availability, exposure to anti-tobacco information, awareness and receptivity to tobacco marketing, knowledge, and attitudes.\nEach row consists of 58 variables including (but not limited to) the percent of current tobacco, cigarette, and bidi users in each Indian state (rural and urban), the median age of initiation, exposure at home, source of products, access to advertisements, anti-smoking campaigns, and percentage of schools creating awareness and following guidelines to be tobacco-free."

Subsequent research on missing values, including the creation of relevant plots, will be conducted.\n\n\n2.2.2 Non - Numeric Values\nUpon closer inspection, it was observed that certain data entries were represented as ‘&lt;7,’ signifying values below 7. Recognizing the importance of having numeric values for comprehensive visualization and analysis, a decision was made to address this issue by imputing the value of 7 in place of ‘&lt;7.’ This imputation strategy aimed to provide a standardized numeric representation, ensuring consistency in the dataset.\n\n\n2.2.3 Feature Reduction\nIn this step, the irrelevant columns that were not providing any useful information were removed. This was done to enhance model performance by mitigating the curse of dimensionality and improving computational efficiency, leading to more accurate and efficient models. By eliminating irrelevant or redundant features, feature reduction enhances generalization, reduces noise, and addresses issues like multicollinearity.\nTotal features - 58\n\nEver users (Features 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) - The columns containing percent of ever tobacco, cigarette, and bidi users are dropped as we are focusing our research on the current users of these products in each state.\nFeature 26 ( ‘Exposure to tobacco smoke at home/public place (%)’) is dropped as we already have ‘Exposure to tobacco smoke at home(%)’ and ‘Exposure to tobacco smoke inside any enclosed public places (%)’, so it is not providing any new information\nFeature 36 and 37 ( ‘Current cigarette smokers who bought cigarettes from a store, paan shop, street vendor, or vending machine(%)’) and ( ‘Current bidi smokers who bought bidi from a store, paan shop, or street vendor (%)’) are dropped as well as it provides repetitive information.\nFeature 41 and 42 ( ‘Bought Cigarette as individual sticks in past 30 days(%)’) and ( ‘Bought Bidi as individual sticks in past 30 days (%)’) are dropped as they do not provide any meaningful insights.\n\nNew number of features - 47\n\n\n2.2.4 Proposal\n\nCompare tobacco use rates (current users) across different states and regions of India to identify patterns and trends geographically. This could examine differences between urban and rural areas as well.\nStudy the effectiveness of anti-tobacco messages and tobacco control policies by correlating measures like exposure to messages, support for policies, quit attempts, etc. with tobacco use rates. This could identify best practices.\nEvaluate the impact of banning smoking in public places by comparing rates of exposure to secondhand smoke in public areas before and after implementation over time across states with different policies.\nExamine access to tobacco products among youth by analyzing refusal rates for cigarette/bidi sales due to age, sources of obtaining tobacco (store, paan shop), and exposure to point-of-sale advertising.\nStudy knowledge, attitudes and perceptions related to tobacco use through measures like harm perception, quitting difficulty, anti-tobacco messaging to characterize differences across states and inform communication campaigns.\nAssess compliance with tobacco control policies (COTPA guidelines, school policies) through school administrator surveys and correlate strength of policy implementation with student tobacco use rates."

While it’s not the best method to replace Null values as it assumes that they are missing at random and that imputing the mean will not introduce bias, we chose this method because we only had three missing values in the entire data frame, out of more than 6000. This made the chances of bias being introduced extremely low.\n\n\n3.1.4 Removing non numeric values\nSince our data primarily consisted of numeric values, we needed to encode the few non-numeric values for proper visualization and analysis. In certain features that depict the median age of initiation of specific tobacco products, there was an entry of ‘&lt;7,’ indicating that the use of these products started even before the age of 7. We replaced this value with the numeric value ‘7,’ which served as the upper bound for the age.\n\n\n3.1.5 Cleaning and shortening the column names\nThe column names in the actual data frame available on the Government of India’s website were lengthy and contained a significant number of special characters and uneven spacing. These names were modified to achieve uniformity, making it easier to analyze the data with fewer errors."

This is followed by ‘smokeless tobacco users’ (Chewing tobacco such as loose leaf, plug, or twigs) in rural areas and e-cigarette users (E-cigs, vapes, and mods) in urban areas.\n‘bidi users’ seem to make up a larger proportion in rural areas compared to urban areas as people have access to a wider variety of tobacco products and ‘bidi’ might not be a preferred option in comparison to the electronic cigarettes, and vapes available in cities.\n\n\n3.2.2 Graph 2: Histograms of Median age of Initiation\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = `Median age of initiation of Cigarette `)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"cornflowerblue\", color = \"purple\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Frequency\", \n       title = \"Age of Initiation of Cigarette Smoke in various States/UT of India\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram shows that the age of initiation of cigarette smoking has a clear peak around ages 13 to 14, with a significant number of initiations occurring between ages 12 and 16. This suggests that many individuals begin smoking cigarettes in their early teenage years. There is an outlier in this data, which signifies that there is a state (Manipur) where people start smoking at a very late age.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = `Median age of initiation of Bidi `)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"cornflowerblue\", color = \"purple\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age of Initiation\", y = \"Frequency\", \n       title = \"Age of Initiation of Bidi in various States/UT of India\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe age of initiation for bidi smoking is also concentrated in the early teenage years, with a notable peak around age 11. However, the distribution is slightly more spread out than that for cigarette smoking, with a range from about 8 to 14 years of age. This might reflect cultural or socioeconomic factors that make bidi smoking accessible or acceptable at a younger age in some areas.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = `Median age of initiation of smokeless tobacco `)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"cornflowerblue\", color = \"purple\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Frequency\", \n       title = \"Age of Initiation of Smokeless Tobacco in various States/UT of India\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor smokeless tobacco, the initiation age starts as early as 6 or 7, with a more dispersed distribution. There is a notable peak at age 9, and other smaller peaks throughout the age range up to 14. This suggests a wider variation in the age at which individuals start using smokeless tobacco, which may be due to differing regional practices or less stringent control over the accessibility of smokeless tobacco products to minors.\nWhen comparing the three histograms, it seems that the initiation of smokeless tobacco starts at a younger age compared to smoking cigarettes or bidi. This could be due to the perception that smokeless tobacco is less harmful, or it could be more easily accessible to younger individuals. The fact that tobacco initiation is occurring in early adolescence (or even childhood) is concerning from a public health perspective. It indicates the need for effective tobacco control measures and education about the risks of tobacco use targeted at children and young teens.\n\n\n3.2.3 Graph 3: Major Sources of Purchase in Rural and Urban India\n\n\nCode\ndf2 &lt;- df[, c(\"State/UT\", \"Area\", \"Cigarette: Store \", \"Cigarette: Paan shop \", \"Bidi: Store \", \"Bidi: Paan shop \", \"Smokeless tobacco: Store \", \"Smokeless tobacco: Paan shop \" )]\n\ndf2 &lt;- df2[df2$Area != \"Total\", ]\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf2_rural &lt;- df2[df2$Area != \"Urban\", ]\ndf2_urban &lt;- df2[df2$Area != \"Rural\", ]\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf2u &lt;- df2_urban |&gt; pivot_longer(cols=c(\"Cigarette: Store \", \"Cigarette: Paan shop \", \"Bidi: Store \", \"Bidi: Paan shop \", \"Smokeless tobacco: Store \", \"Smokeless tobacco: Paan shop \"),\n                    names_to='Sources',\n                    values_to='Percentage') \n#df2u\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf2r &lt;- df2_rural |&gt; pivot_longer(cols=c(\"Cigarette: Store \", \"Cigarette: Paan shop \", \"Bidi: Store \", \"Bidi: Paan shop \", \"Smokeless tobacco: Store \", \"Smokeless tobacco: Paan shop \"),\n                    names_to='Sources',\n                    values_to='Percentage') \n#df2r\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df2u, aes(x = \"Sources\", y = Percentage, fill = Sources)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Sources of Tobacco Products: Urban India\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df2r, aes(x = \"Sources\", y = Percentage, fill = Sources)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Sources of Tobacco Products: Rural India\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\nPaan shops play a significant role as a source of tobacco products in both urban and rural India, as indicated by the substantial segments representing tobacco products obtained from paan shops.\nBidi and smokeless tobacco are frequently purchased from paan shops in both urban and rural settings, underscoring their cultural association with these outlets. The ready availability of paan shops in every neighborhood across India implies that they are easily accessible even to children, which could contribute to the low median age of initiation for these two products.\nThe segments representing cigarettes from stores and paan shops are roughly equal in size in both urban and rural charts, suggesting a balanced distribution of cigarette sources.\nOverall, the pie charts for urban and rural distribution demonstrate minimal variation in the sources for tobacco products. While paan shops serve as a common local source for bidi and smokeless tobacco, the source for cigarettes can be relatively interchangeable between stores and paan shops.\n\n\n3.2.4 Graph 4: E-cigarette Awareness faceted by Area\n\n\nCode\n#df$Awareness &lt;- EDAV_impute$`Awareness about e-cigarette (%)`\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = `State/UT`, y = `Awareness about e-cigarette `, fill = Area)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(x = \"State/UT\", y = \"Awareness (%)\", title = \"Awareness about E-cigarette in Indian States/UTs Faceted by Area\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Area, ncol = 3) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear pattern that in most states and UTs, the awareness levels are higher in urban areas compared to rural areas which can be attributed to better access to information, and a strong influence of western culture and products, specially on impressionable minds that are studied in this survey.\nSome states/UTs show high awareness levels in both rural and urban areas, while others show a stark contrast between the two. This may indicate the spread of information, trends and cultures between the urban and rural areas of the state which can depict the information divide between the two.\nCertain regions, such as Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Tripura stand out with particularly high levels of awareness about e-cigarettes. Further geographical analysis shows that this could be a trend in the mountainous regions of the country, where youth may be more inclined towards electronic cigarettes due to difficulties in using fire for lighting at high altitudes.\nImpossibility - The extremely low level of awareness about E-cigarette use in Karnataka, specially when the rural awareness is at par with others, and the neighbouring states have a significant awareness as well seems to be an incorrect data point.\n\n\nCode\n#General plot - to make it without total:\n\ndf_filtered &lt;- df[df$Area != \"Total\", ]\n\nggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = Area, y = `Awareness about e-cigarette `, fill = Area)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Awareness about E-cigarette in Indian States/UTs faceted by Area\",\n    x = \"Area\",\n    y = \"Awareness about e-cigarette (%)\",\n    fill = NULL\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Area, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph simply shows a higher number of people being aware of E-cigarette use in Urban areas as compared to rural, which agrees with our previous graph that e-cigarettes are consumed more in those regions as compared to the rural ones.\n\n\n3.2.5 Graph 5: Scatterplot - Exposure vs. Tobacco Users\n\n\nCode\n# Scatterplot 1\nsp1 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = `Exposure to tobacco smoke at home `, y = `tobacco users `)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Exposure at Home vs. Current Tobacco Users\",\n    x = \"Exposure to tobacco smoke at home (%)\",\n    y = \"Current tobacco users (%)\"\n  )\n\n# Scatterplot 2\nsp2 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = `Exposure to tobacco smoke inside any enclosed public places `, y = `tobacco users `)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Exposure in Enclosed Public Spaces vs. Current Tobacco Users\",\n    x = \"Exposure to tobacco smoke in enclosed public spaces (%)\",\n    y = \"Current tobacco users (%)\"\n  )\n\n# Scatterplot 3\nsp3 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = `Exposure to tobacco smoke at any outdoor public places `, y = `tobacco users `)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Exposure at Outdoor Public Places vs. Current Tobacco Users\",\n    x = \"Exposure to tobacco smoke at outdoor public places\",\n    y = \"Current tobacco users (%)\"\n  )\n\n# Scatterplot 4\nsp4 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = `Exposure to tobacco smoke at School`, y = `tobacco users `)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Exposure at School vs. Current Tobacco Users\",\n    x = \"Exposure to tobacco smoke at school\",\n    y = \"Current tobacco users (%)\"\n  )\n\ngrid.arrange(sp1, sp2, sp3, sp4, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all environments, there seems to be a general trend that higher exposure to tobacco smoke is associated with higher percentages of current tobacco users, since the scatterplots show a positive correlation in all 4 cases. This may reflect both the influence of being around smokers and the contribution of current smokers to the secondhand smoke in these environments.\n\nExposure at Home: There appears to be a positive correlation between exposure to tobacco smoke at home and the percentage of current tobacco users. This suggests that households with smokers are less likely to restrict smoking, resulting in higher secondhand smoke exposure.\nExposure in Enclosed Public Spaces: The scatter plot shows a wide dispersion of points, suggesting a variable relationship between exposure to tobacco smoke in enclosed public spaces and the percentage of current tobacco users. While there’s a trend of more current tobacco users with increased exposure, the relationship doesn’t appear to be as strong as with home exposure, indicating that other factors may influence tobacco use in these settings.\nExposure at Outdoor Public Places: There is a noticeable positive trend, where higher exposure to tobacco smoke at outdoor public places corresponds to a higher percentage of current tobacco users. This could imply that where smoking is more prevalent in public areas, there is also a higher likelihood of encountering current smokers.\nExposure at School: This scatter plot also indicates a positive trend, although the data points are more scattered. Higher exposure rates at schools correlate with higher percentages of current tobacco users among the observed populations. This might reflect the influence of peer presence and social environments on tobacco use among school-goers.\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Graph 6: Correlation heatmap between the current tobacco smokers and preventive measures taken by the schools in various states\n\n\nCode\nselected_columns &lt;- df_filtered[, c(\"tobacco users \", \"Students who were taught in class about harmful effects of tobacco use during past 12 months \", \"School heads aware of COTPA, 2003 \", \"Schools authorized by the state government to collect fine for violation under Section-6 of the COTPA, 2003 \", \"Schools followed ‘tobacco-free school’ guidelines \", \"Schools aware of the policy for displaying ‘tobacco-free school’ board \")]\n\ncor_matrix &lt;- round(cor(selected_columns),2)\nmelted_cormat &lt;- melt(cor_matrix)\n#head(melted_cormat)\n\nggplot(data = melted_cormat, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2,fill=value)) + \n  geom_tile() +\n  geom_text(aes(Var2, Var1, label = value), color = \"white\", size = 5) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size= 5))\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a strong positive correlation (0.76) between schools being aware of the tobacco-free school policy and following the tobacco-free school guidelines, which suggests that awareness is likely to lead to implementation.\nThe correlation between schools authorized to collect fines under COTPA and school heads’ awareness of COTPA is positive (0.43), indicating that when school heads are aware of the laws, schools are more likely to be involved in enforcement.\nThere is a positive correlation (0.32) between the percentage of tobacco users and students being taught about the harmful effects of tobacco use. The correlation is not that high which might suggest that a more comprehensive education is needed to effectively lower usage rates, as the current one might just be making them aware of the products but not actually making them realize the need to quit/ not start.\nSome variables show very low correlation with each other, like the awareness of the policy for displaying a ‘tobacco-free school’ board and the percentage of tobacco users (-0.06), which implies that simply being aware of the policy does not necessarily translate to a reduction in tobacco usage among students.\n\n\n3.2.7 Graph 7: Scatterplot of Advertisments and Current Tobacco Users\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = `Students who saw tobacco advertisements anywhere in past 30 days `, y = `tobacco users `, color = Area)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Tobacco Advertisments vs. Tobacco Users\",\n    x = \"Students who saw tobacco advertisements anywhere in past 30 days\",\n    y = \"Current tobacco users (%)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be a clear, strong correlation between the exposure to tobacco advertisements and the percentage of current tobacco users. The points are spread across the plot without a distinct pattern indicating a strong linear relationship.\nHowever, it appears that in some cases, urban areas (blue dots) may have a higher percentage of students who have seen tobacco advertisements compared to rural areas (red dots), which could be due to a higher density of advertising platforms and a greater reach in urban areas but this does not uniformly translate to a higher percentage of current tobacco users. The total percentages (green dots) are interspersed among the rural and urban ones, suggesting that the overall pattern is influenced by both rural and urban data and does not favor one over the other significantly.\n\n\n3.2.8 Graph 8: Impact of Pro Tobacco Advertisements on Users\n\n\nCode\ndf3 &lt;- df[, c(\"State/UT\",\"Area\", \"Advertisments: Mass Media\", \"tobacco users \",\"Advertisments: Promotions\")]\n\ndf3_a &lt;- df3[df3$Area != \"Total\", ]\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggparcoord(df3_a, alphaLines = 0.8, columns = 3:5, groupColumn = \"Area\") +\n  labs(title = \"Impact of Pro Tobacco Advertisements on Users\", \n       x = \"\", y = \"\", title.size = 40) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough most of the data trends towards the lower end of the tobacco users axis, careful consideration reveals that higher values on advertisements in mass media imply a greater number of tobacco users. A similar trend is observed in the relationship between promotions and users, indicating a general positive correlation between the two and tobacco use. However, the correlation is not particularly strong, and numerous outliers exist. These outliers may suggest that the data may not precisely reflect reality, potentially containing collection errors, or that advertisements can sometimes evoke repulsion and reduce motivation to purchase tobacco products.\nThe urban lines (in blue) are higher on the advertisement axes, reflecting a higher saturation of tobacco advertisements in urban areas.\nThe lines that appear high on the ‘Tobacco Users’ axis but low on both advertisement axes might represent areas where tobacco use is prevalent despite low advertisement exposure. This suggests that factors other than advertisements influence tobacco use in these regions, such as peer pressure, household exposure, weather conditions, cultural norms, and societal influences.\n\n\n3.2.9 Graph 9: Impact of Anti Tobacco Advertisements on Users\n\n\nCode\ndf4 &lt;- df[, c(\"State/UT\",\"Area\",\"Anti Tobacco messages: Mass media\",\"tobacco users \", \"Anti Tobacco messages: Community events\", \"Anti Tobacco messages: Health Warnings\")]\n\ndf4_a &lt;- df4[df4$Area != \"Total\", ]\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggparcoord(df4_a, alphaLines = 0.8, columns = 3:6, groupColumn = \"Area\") +\n  labs(title = \"Impact of Anti Tobacco Advertisements on Users\", \n       x = \"\", y = \"\", title.size = 40) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot reveals complex relationships, with no clear, single pattern emerging. This suggests that the relationship between anti-tobacco efforts and tobacco usage is multifaceted and may be influenced by additional uncharted factors.\nIn rural areas (indicated by the red lines), most data points in the lower region of the ‘Anti-Tobacco Messages in Mass Media’ axis are associated with high values of tobacco users, indicating a negative correlation. This negative correlation suggests that anti-tobacco advertisements and warnings are effective in reducing tobacco product use.\nOverall, the dominance of blue lines over red lines in the graph indicates that anti-tobacco campaigns are more prevalent, and there is greater effort to curb tobacco use in urban areas compared to rural areas.\nThere are noteworthy observations in this dataset, such as the case where ‘Anti-Tobacco Messages in Community Events’ is extremely low (indicated by the urban area’s blue line), but tobacco use in this region is also very low. This suggests that tobacco use is so minimal that extensive anti-tobacco programs may not be necessary."

    "text": "Inferences from the graph\nThe graph illustrates the statewise impact of various anti-tobacco and pro-tobacco strategies on tobacco cessation efforts in India. The X-axis displays different strategies categorized into two groups:\n\nStrategies aimed at promoting tobacco cessation or discouraging its use, such as spreading health warnings, coverage in mass media, and organizing community events. These strategies are assumed to have a positive impact by increasing the percentage of tobacco users who want to quit.\nStrategies that appear to promote tobacco use, such as tobacco advertisements and promotions, typically employed by tobacco companies. These may have a negative impact by potentially decreasing the percentage of tobacco users who want to quit.\n\nThe height of each bar indicates the level of influence or the extent to which each strategy is employed within the states. For example, a taller bar for “Health Warnings” suggests a higher percentage of anti-tobacco messaging impact in that particular state.\nThe first bar represents the number of tobacco smokers who plan on quitting. Comparing these figures to the anti and pro-tobacco strategies shows their impact on the decisions of people living in those areas. A higher percentage of people who want to quit helps us understand what is working effectively in a state, while a lower number indicates what isn’t the need for further strategy implementation and curbing advertisements in those areas.\nThe key takeaway from this graph is to compare the extent to which anti-tobacco strategies are implemented and effective against pro-tobacco strategies within states. Policymakers and public health officials can use this data to assess the current landscape of tobacco control efforts and plan future public health campaigns. It can also help identify areas where additional resources might be required to combat the influence of tobacco advertising and promotions. Additionally, this analysis can be further refined by considering the urban and rural demographics to tailor policies more effectively"

    "text": "5.1 Inferences after Exploratory Data Analysis:\nOur comprehensive analysis of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS-4) data has provided critical insights into the patterns and prevalence of tobacco use among school-going adolescents aged 13-15 in India. This demographic is particularly vulnerable to initiating and establishing tobacco use, with potentially grave long-term health and social consequences. Through a robust assessment, including parallel coordinates plots and correlation matrices, we have dissected the multifaceted nature of tobacco exposure among teens.\nOur findings suggest a complex interplay between tobacco use and exposure to pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco advertisements. The data highlights significant differences between urban and rural areas in terms of exposure and tobacco use, suggesting the need for geographically tailored interventions. We observed that while there is a general trend of higher advertisement exposure correlating with tobacco use, the presence of anti-tobacco campaigns does not uniformly translate to decreased usage, indicating that other influencing factors are at play.\nThe accessibility of tobacco products through stores and paan shops varies across states, suggesting the need for stricter enforcement of sales regulations to minors. Moreover, the effectiveness of anti-tobacco messages and policies appears varied; thus, there’s a pressing need for strategies that resonate more effectively with youth.\nA critical factor in our study is the implementation of tobacco control policies within schools. Our analysis indicates that awareness of the COTPA (Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act) among school heads, coupled with the actual implementation of tobacco-free guidelines, is positively associated with lower rates of tobacco use among students. This underscores the importance of not only formulating robust policies but also ensuring their diligent enforcement.\nIn conclusion, our study reaffirms that tobacco use among adolescents in India is a pressing public health issue that requires immediate and targeted action. It is imperative to strengthen existing policies and introduce innovative, culturally sensitive educational programs. There should be a concerted effort to increase the effectiveness of anti-tobacco messages, ensure strict compliance with COTPA, particularly in schools, and reduce the visibility of tobacco advertisements that target the youth. Only through a multifaceted approach can we hope to curb the rise of tobacco use among young individuals in India and safeguard the health of future generations."

    "text": "5.2 Future Scope\nBuilding on the insights gained from our current analysis, there are several avenues for future research that can deepen our understanding of adolescent tobacco use and enhance the effectiveness of tobacco control strategies:\n\nLongitudinal Studies: Conduct longitudinal studies to track the same group of adolescents over time. This would provide insights into how tobacco use patterns evolve and the long-term efficacy of anti-tobacco initiatives.\nQualitative Research: Incorporate qualitative research methods, such as interviews and focus groups with adolescents, to understand the social and psychological factors that influence tobacco use and the perceived effectiveness of current anti-tobacco messaging and policies, since the current data is showing that there are other reasons at play and not just the ones we have considered yet.\nPolicy Impact Studies: Evaluate the impact of specific policies, such as tax increases on tobacco products, smoke-free legislation, and restrictions on tobacco advertising, on adolescent tobacco use patterns, which could be important information for the government as it needs to implement accordingly.\nDigital Media Influence: Examine the role of digital media and social networks in promoting or discouraging tobacco use among adolescents. This could include the impact of online anti-tobacco campaigns and the presence of pro-tobacco content on social media platforms.\nAccess Control Measures: Study the effectiveness of measures to control access to tobacco, such as ID checks and penalties for selling to minors, and the role of informal channels like family and friends in providing access to tobacco products."
