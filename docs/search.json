    "text": "1.1 About the topic\nAdolescents are the most vulnerable population to initiate tobacco use. It is now well established that most of the adult users of tobacco start tobacco use in childhood or adolescence. There has been a perceptible fall in smoking in developed countries after the realization of the harmful effects of tobacco. The tobacco companies are now aggressively targeting their advertising strategies in developing countries like India. Understanding the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use in specific demographics, such as school-going children aged 13-15, is crucial for implementing targeted interventions and prevention strategies. The GYTS-4 is a robust survey designed to produce national estimates, providing valuable data on various aspects of tobacco use among school-going children."

    "text": "1.2 Inspiration\nSmoking in teens is a growing concern for several reasons, reflecting the potential short-term and long-term health, social, and economic consequences, like:\n\nHealth Risks: Adolescents who smoke are exposed to the same health risks as adults, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and various cancers.\nAddiction and Nicotine Dependence: Teens are more vulnerable to developing nicotine dependence than adults as the adolescent brain is still developing, and exposure to nicotine during this critical period can lead to addiction, making it harder for individuals to quit smoking later in life.\nEarly Initiation Leads to Lifelong Habits: Research indicates that individuals who start smoking during adolescence are more likely to continue smoking into adulthood.\nImpact on Academic Performance: Smoking can negatively impact academic performance. Nicotine can affect concentration, memory, and cognitive function, potentially hindering a teen’s ability to succeed in school.\nSocial and Behavioral Consequences: Smoking may lead to isolation, strained relationships with non-smoking peers, and engagement in risky behaviors. Additionally, smoking is often associated with other substance use.\n\nTo address these concerns, comprehensive and evidence-based tobacco control strategies, including education, prevention programs, and policy measures, are crucial to reduce the prevalence of smoking among teenagers and protect their long-term health and well-being. We are attempting to figure out trends among teens currently smoking in each state, segregated by rural and urban areas, and assess how these trends are affected by exposure to tobacco smoke at home and in public places. Additionally, we aim to understand the impact of advertisements, warning labels, promotions, bans, and awareness programs initiated by their schools."

The first three rounds of GYTS were conducted in 2003, 2006, and 2009.\nA total of 97,302 students from 987 schools (Public-544; Private-443) participated in the survey. Of these, 80,772 students aged 13-15 years were considered for reporting. The objective of the survey was to provide information on tobacco use, cessation, second-hand smoke, access and availability, exposure to anti-tobacco information, awareness and receptivity to tobacco marketing, knowledge, and attitudes.\nEach row consists of 58 variables including (but not limited to) the percent of current tobacco, cigarette, and bidi users in each Indian state (rural and urban), the median age of initiation, exposure at home, source of products, access to advertisements, anti-smoking campaigns, and percentage of schools creating awareness and following guidelines to be tobacco-free."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\n\n2.2.1 Missing Values\nWe plan to begin by comprehensively understanding our data, prioritizing the handling of missing and null values. Subsequent research on missing values, including the creation of relevant plots, will be conducted.\n\n\n2.2.2 Non - Numeric Values\nUpon closer inspection, it was observed that certain data entries were represented as ‘&lt;7,’ signifying values below 7. Recognizing the importance of having numeric values for comprehensive visualization and analysis, a decision was made to address this issue by imputing the value of 7 in place of ‘&lt;7.’ This imputation strategy aimed to provide a standardized numeric representation, ensuring consistency in the dataset.\n\n\n2.2.3 Feature Reduction\nIn this step, the irrelevant columns that were not providing any useful information were removed. This was done to enhance model performance by mitigating the curse of dimensionality and improving computational efficiency, leading to more accurate and efficient models. By eliminating irrelevant or redundant features, feature reduction enhances generalization, reduces noise, and addresses issues like multicollinearity.\nTotal features - 58\n\nEver users (Features 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) - The columns containing percent of ever tobacco, cigarette, and bidi users are dropped as we are focusing our research on the current users of these products in each state.\nFeature 26 ( ‘Exposure to tobacco smoke at home/public place (%)’) is dropped as we already have ‘Exposure to tobacco smoke at home(%)’ and ‘Exposure to tobacco smoke inside any enclosed public places (%)’, so it is not providing any new information\nFeature 36 and 37 ( ‘Current cigarette smokers who bought cigarettes from a store, paan shop, street vendor, or vending machine(%)’) and ( ‘Current bidi smokers who bought bidi from a store, paan shop, or street vendor (%)’) are dropped as well as it provides repetitive information.\nFeature 41 and 42 ( ‘Bought Cigarette as individual sticks in past 30 days(%)’) and ( ‘Bought Bidi as individual sticks in past 30 days (%)’) are dropped as they do not provide any meaningful insights.\n\nNew number of features - 47\n\n\n2.2.4 Proposal\n\nCompare tobacco use rates (current users) across different states and regions of India to identify patterns and trends geographically. This could examine differences between urban and rural areas as well.\nStudy the effectiveness of anti-tobacco messages and tobacco control policies by correlating measures like exposure to messages, support for policies, quit attempts, etc. with tobacco use rates. This could identify best practices.\nEvaluate the impact of banning smoking in public places by comparing rates of exposure to secondhand smoke in public areas before and after implementation over time across states with different policies.\nExamine access to tobacco products among youth by analyzing refusal rates for cigarette/bidi sales due to age, sources of obtaining tobacco (store, paan shop), and exposure to point-of-sale advertising.\nStudy knowledge, attitudes and perceptions related to tobacco use through measures like harm perception, quitting difficulty, anti-tobacco messaging to characterize differences across states and inform communication campaigns.\nAssess compliance with tobacco control policies (COTPA guidelines, school policies) through school administrator surveys and correlate strength of policy implementation with student tobacco use rates."

Notably, the remaining features in this dataset show no instances of missing values, suggesting that the dataset is generally free from substantial issues related to incomplete data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar graph illustrates that more than 50 features have no missing values, while only one feature has one missing value, and another feature has two missing values."
